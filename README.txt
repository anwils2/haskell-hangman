CS 557 Functional Programming
Final Project

Welcome to Escape! Escape is a simple spelling guessing game similar to hangman. 
One player is the heroic knight who has been trapped inside the lair of a terrifying undead monster 
unless he can determine the magical phrase to teleport him out to safety. The other player is the mastermind
who has trapped the hero and determines the escape phrase.

Can our hero escape before the monster emerges from the darkness? Play now and find out!
